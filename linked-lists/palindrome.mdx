# Palindrome

## Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 2.6

<br />

## Question

You are given a linked list. Write a function that checks if the values in the linked list will form a palindrome. In other words, if you reverse the linked list, the values will still be the same.

```
Input - 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1
Output - True

Input - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1
Output - True

Input - 1 -> 2
Output - False
```

  <summary>Solution</summary>


Let's ignore the Linked List component for a second. If you just had a string, how could you tell if it was a palindrome?

<br />

You could just create a copy of the string and reverse it. Then, compare that to the original string.

<br />

If they're equivalent, then you have a palindrome.

<br />

Therefore, with a linked list input, we could just copy the linked list, reverse it and check if it's equivalent to the original linked list.

<br />

The issue with this approach is that it requires extra space ($$O(n)$$ space complexity). Can we solve this question using no extra space?

<br />

We can, by iterating through half of the linked list, and then reversing the second half. Then, we compare the reversed second half with the original first half and check to make sure they're both equivalent. If the linked list had an odd length, then we just ignore the middle element.

```python
def reverseLL(head):
    prev = None
    while head:
        temp = head.next
        head.next = prev
        prev = head
        head = temp
    return prev

def palindrome(head):
    # An empty LL is a palindrome
    if head is None:
        return True

    # get length of linked list
    length = 0
    cur = head
    while cur:
        length += 1
        cur = cur.next

    # find halfway point
    if length % 2 == 0:
        halfWay = length // 2
    elif length % 2 == 1:
        halfWay = length // 2 + 1

    # reverse second half
    cur = head
    for _ in range(halfWay - 1):
        cur = cur.next

    secondHalf = cur.next
    cur.next = None

    secondHalf = reverseLL(secondHalf)

    # compare both halves
    firstHalf = head
    while firstHalf and secondHalf:
        if firstHalf.val != secondHalf.val:
            return False
        firstHalf = firstHalf.next
        secondHalf = secondHalf.next

    return True
```

The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
