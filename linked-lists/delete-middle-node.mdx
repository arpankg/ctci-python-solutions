# Delete Middle Node

## Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 2.3

<br />

## Question

You're given a pointer to a node in a singly linked list. The node will NOT be the last node in the singly linked list. Write a function that deletes only that node in the linked list in-place. You don't have to return anything since the deletion is in-place.

```
Linked List - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3
Input - 4 -> 5 -> 3
Result after running function - 1 -> 2-> 3 -> 5 -> 3
```

We can't solve this by the standard way of deleting a node in a linked list.

<br />

In order to do that, we'd typically need a pointer to the node _right before_ the node we want to delete. Then we can set the previous node's `next` to `next.next` and that would remove the node from the linked list.

<br />

We don't have access to the previous node. Can you think of another way to delete the node our pointer is pointing at?

  <summary>Solution</summary>


We need to modify the original linked list and delete the node that the pointer is pointing at. We can't delete the node because we don't have a pointer to the previous node (check hint). Therefore, we can mimic a deletion by copying over the value from the next node into the node we want to delete. Then, we can just delete the next node in the standard fashion.

```python
def deleteNode(node):
    node.val = node.next.val
    node.next = node.next.next
```

The time complexity is $$O(1)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
