# Return Kth to Last Node

## Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 2.2

<br />

## Question

You're given a Linked List. Write a function to find the Kth to last node in that Linked List.

```
Input - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None, k = 2
Output - 4
```

We can utilize a `slow` and `fast` pointer here. The key is that the `fast` pointer should be `k` nodes ahead of the `slow` pointer. Once the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the Linked List, we can return the node that the `slow` pointer is pointing to.

```python
def returnKthToLast(head, k):
    fast = head
    for _ in range(k):
        if fast:
            fast = fast.next
        else:
            return None
    slow = head
    # fast is now k nodes ahead of slow

    while fast:
        fast = fast.next
        slow = slow.next

    return slow
```

The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
