# Loop Detection

## Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 2.8

<br />

## Question

You are given a linked list as input. The linked list may or may not have a cycle. Write a function that returns the node at the beginning of the cycle (if it exists) or `None`.

```
Input - 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 (same 2 as earlier)
Output - 2
```

  <summary>Brute Force Solution</summary>


We can solve this by using a set. We just iterate through the linked list and check if the current node is in our set (have we already seen this node)? If `true`, then we return the node. Otherwise, we add the node to the set and continue iterating. If we reach the end of the linked list, then there obviously isn't a cycle and we can return `None`.

```python
def loopDetection(head):
    seenNodes = set()
    cur = head

    while cur:
        if cur in seenNodes:
            return cur
        else:
            seenNodes.add(cur)
            cur = cur.next
```

The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(n)$$.

The fastest we can do is $$O(n)$$ time complexity. But can we improve space complexity?

<br />

We can! We can solve this in constant space using Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. This algorithm is pretty simple to understand, but it's best if done with a video. Therefore, we'll let [Gayle explain it herself!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFOAbpfrJ8g).

```python
def intersection(head):
    slow, fast = head.next, head.next.next

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return slow
```

The time complexity is $$O(n)$$ and the space complexity is $$O(1)$$.
