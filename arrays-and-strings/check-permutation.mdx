# Check Permutation

## Question

The input is two strings. Check if the first string is a permutation of the second string.

```
Input - "wazup bro", " orbpuwaz"
Output - True

Input - "hiiiya", "hiya"
Output - False
```

  <summary>Brute Force Solution</summary>

<br />

Sort the characters in both strings. Then, check if the strings are equivalent. 

<br />

If they are, that means that they consist of the same characters and are a permutation of each other.

<br />

The time complexity is $$O(n \log n)$$ since we're sorting the characters in both strings. The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ since we're creating new strings for `s1` and `s2`.

```python
def checkPermutation(s1, s2):
    s1, s2 = sorted(s1), sorted(s2)
    return s1 == s2
```

1. Create a dictionary
2. Iterate through the first string
   - if the char is in the dictionary, increment 1 to it's value
   - if the char is not in the dictionary, set it's value to 1

After the iteration ends, we will a dictionary where the keys are the letters in the first string, and the values are the number of times that letter appears in the first string.

Now, we iterate through the second string and _subtract_ 1 for each character from our dictionary's values. If we come across a character that's not in our dictionary we can immediately return False, since the two strings would have all the same characters if they were permutations.

3. Iterate through the second string

   - if the char is in the dictionary, decrement 1
   - if the char is not in the dictionary, return `False`

   Check if the value in the dictionary for the char is 0. If it is, delete the char from the dictionary, since we're done comparing the counts for that char between both strings.

4. return `True` if the length of the dictionary is 0. That means that all the chars in the first string had an equivalent count in the second string and that the second string didn't have any extra chars that weren't in the first string.

```python
def checkPermutation(s1, s2):
    count = {}
    for i in s1:
        count[i] = count.get(i, 0) + 1
    for i in s2:
        if i in count:
            count[i] -= 1
            if count[i] == 0:
                del count[i]
        else:
            return False
    return len(count) == 0
```

The time complexity is $$O(n)$$. The space complexity is $$O(n)$$.
