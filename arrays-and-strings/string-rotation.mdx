# String Rotation

## Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 1.9

<br />

## Question

You are given two strings as input. Write a function to check if one string is a rotation of the
other string. An example of a rotation is

<br />

`"CodingInterview", "erviewCodingInt"`

You will also be given a function `isSubstring` that will return a boolean that is `True` if one string is a substring of the other. You can only call this function once.

```
Input - "CodingInterview", "erviewCodingInt"
Output - True

Input - "Test", "est"
Output - False
```

  <summary>Solution</summary>


Let's label the input strings `x1` and `x2`. If x1 is a rotation of x2 then there must be a rotation point. An example is if `x1` is `"erviewCodingInt"` and `x2` is `"CodingInterview"`. Then, the rotation point is after `"CodingInt"`. We can imagine spliting `x2` at the rotation point into `a` and `b` where `a` is `"CodingInt"` and `b` is `"erview"`.

<br />

Then, `x1` is `ba` and `x2` is `ab`.

<br />

`x1 = erviewCodingInt = b + a = erview + CodingInt`

`x2 = CodingInterview = a + b = CodingInt + erview`

<br />

So, we want to see if we can split `x2` into `a` and `b` so that `ba = x1` and `ab = x2`.

<br />

We can also see that `ba` will always be a substring of `ab + ab`, as there is a `ba` after the first `a`. Therefore, `x1` will always be a substring of `x2 + x2`.

<br />

We can check if `x1` is a rotation of `x2` by seeing if `x1` is a substring of `x2 + x2`.

```python
def isRotation(x1, x2):
    return isSubstring(x1, x2 + x2)
```

The time complexity of this code is $$O(n + m)$$ where $$n$$ is the length of `x1` and $$m$$ is the length of `x2`. We are assuming that `isSubstring` runs in $$O(n + m)$$ time. Concatinating `x2 + x2` will take $$O(m)$$ time.

Therefore, the time complexity is $$O(n + m)$$. The space complexity is $$O(n + m)$$ as well.
