# Question

Given a sorted (increasing order) array with uniq integer elements, write an algorithm to create binary search tree with minimal height

```
Input - [1,2,3]
Output -   2
          / \
         1   3

Input -  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
Output -                6
                     /      \
                   3         9
                 /   \      /  \
                1     4    7    10
                  \     \   \     \
                   2     5   8     11

  <summary>Solution One</summary>

Insert all elements of the array one by one to a self balancing binary search tree like Red-Black tree or AVL tree.
    
```python

def build_minimal_height_bst(nums):
    # here SelfBalancingBST would be your implementaion of BST with self balancing property.
    tree = SelfBalancingBST()
    for item in nums:
        tree.insert(item)
    return tree

```
Time complexity O(nlog(n)), each insertion takes log(n) time and we do it for all elements of the array.
Space complexity O(1)

  <summary>Solution Two</summary>

Since the array is sorted pick mid element as root and recursively build left subtree with elements lesser than mid and right subtree with the 
elements greater than the mid.

```python
from typing Import List
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.right = None
        self.left = None


def build_minimal_height_BST(nums: List[int], left: int, right: int) -> Node:
    if left > right:
        return None
    mid = left + (right - left) // 2
    root = Node(nums[mid])
    root.left = build_minimal_height_BST(nums, left, mid - 1)
    root.right = build_minimal_height_BST(nums, mid + 1, right)
    return root
```
Time complexity O(n), we visit all the elements of the array once.
Space complexity O(h) where h is height of the tree, recursion stack depth is equal to height of the tree.
